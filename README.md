üåÄ Doctor Strange Magical Circle Animation using Python This project visually replicates the iconic Doctor Strange magical portal/circle using Python and OpenCV (or Pygame/Matplotlib, depending on your implementation). It's a fun blend of geometry, trigonometry, and animation ‚Äî perfect for beginners and Marvel fans looking to explore graphical programming in Python.

‚ú® Features Generates a glowing, animated magic circle similar to Doctor Strange's spell casting.

Uses polar coordinates, rotating shapes, and trigonometric functions for effects.

Customizable colors, glow effects, and animation speed.

Runs as a standalone Python script.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used Python 3.x

OpenCV (for image rendering and animation)

NumPy (for math operations)

Matplotlib / Pygame (alternative for drawing, optional)

Run the script

python 5_make_it_spin.py
